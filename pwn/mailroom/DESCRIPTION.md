# Mailroom
Welcome to the DSU mailroom! Here we sort mail, fill envelopes, and stuff mailboxes.

We're a bit behind schedule today so I'll tl;dr the training:

1. Stuff the envelope to be mailed in any of your mailboxes.
2. You can check what's being sent by opening a mailbox.
3. When ready, seal the mailbox to secure it.
4. We also have a special mailbox for secrets. It gets sealed as soon as you stuff it.

Oh, and btw, our mailboxes are equipped with state-of-the-art quantum envelope recyclers.
Try not to get quantum entagled with the outgoing messages.

Now then, let's get going. We have heaps of messages in our backlog so get to 
sealing mailboxes on the double!
