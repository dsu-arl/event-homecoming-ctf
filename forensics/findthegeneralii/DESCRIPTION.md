# Find the General I

You were able to find where General Cyber was hidden! However, when the police arrived, the criminals had already left and moved General Cyber to a new location. All that remained was a drive that they must had left by accident. 

On it, they found yet another picture that seemed suspicious! It was a JPEG with a message against general cyber, but is there something deeper hidden in it?
